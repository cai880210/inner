Version 1.5
 - Changing the default to ShowParams=1 and RandomFacet=1
 - When MessageLevel=3 the progress report shows three more
   values: how many facets go through the vertex just added
   (value after eq:), how many facets have been thrown (out:)
   and how many new facets are added (new:)
 - New heuristics added: keep a vertex pool and choose the
   vertex which produces the largest number of "out" facets.
   The value of the new keyword VertexPoolSize determines the
   size of the pool; the default value is 0, which means no
   pool.
